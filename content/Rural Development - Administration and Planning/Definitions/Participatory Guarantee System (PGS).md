PGS is a way of making sure that the food grown by the cluster is genuinely organic. It is a decentralized certification system where instead of having an outside company come and check, the farmers and consumers in the local area are involved in the checking process. They visit each other’s farms, see the methods used, and ensure everything is up to the mark. It’s built on trust within the community.
