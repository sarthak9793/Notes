Cluster-based organic farming is a method where a group of farmers come together to practice organic farming on a shared piece of land (50 acres for PKVY). This approach allows them to:
- **Share Resources**: They can pool together resources like seeds, manure, and knowledge about organic practices.
- **Reduce Costs**: By working together, they can lower the costs of inputs and certification.
- **Learn and Innovate**: Farmers can learn from each other and innovate better farming techniques.
- **Certify Easily**: Itâ€™s easier to get organic certification as a group rather than individually.
